This is the set of code for my personal website (you can access it here: https://kx-wang.github.io/)!

It uses the "prologue" template from https://html5up.net/, and the contact form was created using Formspree (see https://dev.to/charalambosioannou/create-a-static-webpage-with-a-contact-form-on-github-pages-3532).
